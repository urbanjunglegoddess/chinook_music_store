## Overview

  

The Chinook Database project involves querying the Chinook Database, which contains information about a music store. The goal of this project is to assist the Chinook team in understanding their media inventory, customers, employees, and invoice information. The project includes three main steps:

  

1. **Step 1: Get the Chinook database up and running:** This step involves setting up the DB Browser database on your own machine or using the provided workspace.
2. **Step 2: Complete the SQL Question Sets:** This step consists of answering a series of questions to assess your understanding of the main concepts taught in the SQL lessons. These questions are for self-assessment purposes and will not be graded by a reviewer.
3. **Step 3: Create the Presentation:** In this step, you have the freedom to be creative and ask your own questions based on the data in the Chinook Database. You will write SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data and use it to build a visual representation (such as a bar chart, histogram, or plot). Finally, you will present your findings in a slide deck using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or any other preferred presentation software.

  

Completing these steps will help you gain proficiency in SQL and demonstrate your ability to analyze and visualize data from a real-world database. For more details on project submission, please refer to the Project Submission Details page.

  

## Business Problem/Business Task

The Chinook team needs assistance with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. They also need help in creating a presentation that answers specific questions using SQL queries and visualizations.SQL: Question Set 1

  

## Objective

The objective of the project is to assist the Chinook team in understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. Additionally, the objective is to create a presentation that answers specific questions using SQL queries and visualizations.

##   

## Scope

  

1. Create a presentation with four slides.
2. Include one visualization per slide in the presentation.
3. Write a 1-2 sentence explanation for each slide.
4. Use SQL queries to create the data used in the visualizations.
5. Ensure that if any previous queries are used, they must include a JOIN as stated in the Rubric.
6. Save the presentation slides as a PDF for review.
7. Prepare a text file that includes each of the SQL queries used to create the visualizations.
8. Ensure all SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
9. Each SQL query should include one or more explicit join(s) and one or more aggregation(s).
10. Format the SQL queries for readability using a SQL formatting tool like [sqlformat.org](http://sqlformat.org) or [sql-format.com](http://sql-format.com).
11. Paste the formatted SQL code into a plain text file (.txt).
12. Use a spreadsheet application, such as Excel or Google Sheets, to create your visualizations.
13. Ensure all four final submitted queries contain a JOIN and AGGREGATION.
14. Review the project against the Project Rubric.
15. Once completed, put the text file and presentation in a folder, zip it, and submit the zipped folder for the project.
16. No additional data prep (sorting, filtering, renaming, etc.) should be done between the query output and the visualization.
17. After finishing the project, submit the presentation as a PDF and the queries as a .txt file.

## Deliverables

A presentation that should include:

*   Four slides
*   One visualization per slide
*   A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
*   The SQL query is used to create the data used in the visualization.

  

## Data Preprocessing

Steps taken to preprocess data

*       *   Create a duplicate of the raw data
    *   Renamed the duplicate sheet
    *   Used the insert table feature to transform the existing information into a table
    *   Identify the missing values
    *   Ensure that all data is in a common and consistent format.
    *   Create a data dictionary for name ranges
    *   Create required sheets
    *   Create a workflow for data manipulation
    *   Create plan to shape model, pivot tables, and profit/loss sheet
    *   Identify metrics to use for analysis
    *   Choose interactive feature
